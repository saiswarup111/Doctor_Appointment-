# Doctor-Appointment-System using MERN stack

This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to provide a user-friendly and efficient system for managing doctor appointments. Patients can search for doctors by specialty, location, or availability, book appointments, view their appointment history, and manage their profile information. Doctors can manage their schedules, view patient information, and update appointment statuses.
